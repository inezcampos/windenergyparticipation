### Descriptive Statistics of a Database of Participatory Practices and Social Innovation in Wind Energy Developments
This work results from the JustWind4All Horizon Europe project. A systematic review of documents, which included research articles, news media, websites, blogs, and deliverables from European research projects, led to a database of participatory practices and social innovation in the context of onshore and offshore wind energy developments. The database includes a dataset of 399 entries, describing participatory practices and social innovations. A smaller dataset of 318 entries has been retrieved from this larger dataset, which describes case studies only. To illustrate the data collected, an [interactive visualization in TABLEAU](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ines.campos/viz/ParticipationLevelsinWindEnergyProjects/Sheet2) enables quick filtering of the participation level and opportunities for participation in the examples collected across the globe. 
The Jupyter notebooks included in this repository are only producing simple descriptive statistics of the larger dataset, which are published in the [JustWind4ALL](https://justwind4all.eu/) deliverable -  D3.1 DATABASE OF GOOD PARTICIPATORY PRACTICES AND SOCIAL INNOVATIONS IN ON AND OFF-SHORE WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENTS. Additional analysis as well as the full dataset will be openly available and added to this repository in 2024 after the authors have an opportunity to publish their findings in peer review.
